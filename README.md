# Hotel Reservation Predictor App
Machine learning model and interactive **Streamlit application** to predict hotel booking cancellations based on guest, booking, and pricing details. The project covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, saving model artifacts, and building a user-friendly web app for real-time predictions.

---

## Overview
This project was developed for the **Model Deployment** course (4th semester) and focuses on building a predictive model to determine whether a hotel booking will be canceled or not.  

The workflow includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling, and balancing classes)
- Model experimentation and evaluation (XGBoost vs Random Forest)
- Saving the final model and preprocessing objects for deployment
- Preparing test cases for a Streamlit application

**Deliverables include:**
- **Python notebook** ‚Äì complete preprocessing, model training, and evaluation pipeline
- **Saved model artifacts** ‚Äì `.pkl` files for deployment
- **Streamlit-ready input format** ‚Äì for real-time prediction
- **Documentation** ‚Äì step-by-step project explanation
